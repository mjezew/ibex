Welcome!
</p>
<p>
In this experiment you will be listening to 36 dialogues, each consisting of a question by the first speaker and a response by the second. 
</p><p>
Sometimes, the answer will sound entirely natural given the question, but sometimes, it might not seem so natural.
</p><p>
Your task is to carefully listen to the dialogues, and evaluate how natural the response seems given the question.

Thank for your participation!
